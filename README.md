Ugly way to solve a simple problem. 

This was an assignment to read the data from a file: "scores.dat" and assign them a point value. 
The data are x/y coordinates on an archery target of Radius 1, with an inner circle of radius 0.5
Any hit in the inner circle are given 2 points, any hits in the outer circle are given 1 point. 

Each line in the data file corresponds to the scores of one archer. 

Calculate the scores of the four archers and display the winner. 

It's ugly, but it works. I bashed my head against trying to get some loops to work, but the deadline approacheth. 

Have fun.
